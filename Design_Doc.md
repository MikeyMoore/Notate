# Notate Design

## Design Goals Iteration 1
- 

## User Research Iteration 1
- For Iteration 1 the team focused their attention on personal experience and gathered general research from chess players. 
- Since those that do not play chess are unlikely to use the app, all users from which we received feedback from were chess players themselves.
- Of players surveyed, ease of use and simplicity were the most cited desires from the app.
